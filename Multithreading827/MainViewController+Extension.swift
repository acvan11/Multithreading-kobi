    /* MARK: GCD - Grand Central Dispatch - Multithreading
     
     In IOS dev - we have 4 threads - 2 background/ 2 main threads
     Thread is the context in which you do work, and the queue holds work items to be done
     
     Sync vs Async - sync will NOT continue execution until work items are done, async will continue and do more work
     concurrent vs serial - concurrent is simultaneous, serial is one at time
     
     Use background thread for large amounts of work - downloading data, or expensive tasks
     Use Main Thread for UI changes/updates
